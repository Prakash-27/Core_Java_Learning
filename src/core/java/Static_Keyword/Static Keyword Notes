STATIC KEYWORD:
===============
1)static keyword can be used with class, variable, method and blocks.
2)belong to the class instead of a Specific instance, this means if you make a member static, you can access it without object.

Example Program(static method):
===============================
1)create a static method and call it without object.
NOTE: we can call static method from non-static method but in other hands we can't call non-static method in static method.

Static Block:
=============
1)initializing the static variables.
2)gets executed when the class is loaded in the memory.
3)can have multiple static blocks, execution in written order.
Example: write a program with single and multi static Block.

Static Variables:
=================
1)common to all the instances (or objects) of the class because it is a class level variable.
2)only a single copy of static variable is created and shared among all the instances of the class.

Static class:
=============
A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.
we don't need this.Because we won't use nested class.
